CS-255-X6347 System Analysis and Design 21EW6

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

The DriverPass project is a system used for a a drivers education school to register students, sell lesson packages, and schedule driving lessons. It will also be a platform for online learning materials and practice tests. Students will be able to track their progress and review notes about lessons that they have completed. In particular, I feel that I did well at reviewing a transcript of an interview with the client and translating this to a list of requirements. There were a lot of details to keep track of, so making sure to include these details meant the project was developed as requested.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would remake my use case diagram outside of LucidChart, as I reached a limit on number of shapes in my free .edu access. Another solution would be do create separate use case diagrams for each user, which would help keep the diagram easy to understand.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It's important to consider the user's needs when designing, because every detail must be accounted to create code that will meet the requirements. I was surprised at how many details were needed in the UML class diagram when I payed close attention to all requirements requested by the client.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

By using a combination of diagram styles, it is possible to communicate information about a system from different perspectives. This increases the ability to communicate with a team and produce better end products. An iterative approach can keep the project evolving until it is satisfactory.
